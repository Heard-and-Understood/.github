# Heard & Understood

This organization supports the mission of the [Vermont Conversation Lab](https://vermontconversationlab.com/) at the [University of Vermont](https://www.uvm.edu/) to understand and promote human connection. We are interested in the idea of scalable conversation measurement to understand scalable, meaningful and unbiased measures that tend to what actually happens during interactions and how persons experience those conversations.
